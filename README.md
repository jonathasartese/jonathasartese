My name is Jonathas Artese from Brazil (🇧🇷). I've been working as Software Developer since 2013 and currently I'm Sr Software Developer at [Positivo Tecnologia](https://www.positivotecnologia.com.br). 
I'm passionate about technology and software development, so I always do courses and private projects to learn new techniques and technologies.

In my free time I like to play (and watch) soccer (⚽️) and basketball(:basketball:), to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺), to read books (📚), to listen to music (🎵) and eventually I like to go out with my friends to talk about life with a beer (🍺).

Would you like to find me?
